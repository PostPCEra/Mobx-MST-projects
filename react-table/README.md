## React Table : Hooks for building fast and extendable tables and datagrids for React

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- step 2: /src folder files are added from [this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/master/archives/v6-examples/react-table-custom-filtering) which is is ONE of the Example of  github repo [react-table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table)


- other good examples from above git repo page
 --  Custom  filter [- grouping](https://8lp4kkovv0.codesandbox.io/)
 -- [editable](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/master/archives/v6-examples/react-table-editable-content) 
 -- [table cell renders](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/master/archives/v6-examples/react-table-cell-renderers)

### Notes on using this as basis for our 'Knowledge base Notes' application ( fast one page Filtertable serach)
- see if we can use above [Editable] for quick modification of existing records. : we can keep 2 fields one to edit URL , other filed ( of same vlaue) as clickable URL. If not we may need to add Mobx-MST and do all that DATA stuff with a PopUP 'ADD new Record' Form
- above Custom Group Filter seems good , we may use to Filter our groups?

### Notes on various "React Tables" components on internet (github)
- The above one react-table is highly customizable so making is suitable to go as PART of any 'enterprise web application' . see [HOC extensions](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/v6#hoc-extensions) 
- there are some  "React Table" components that is specalized to dispaly GIGA data sets ( such as Millio rows) they are good at that ( 1M rows). The above good at 'cutomization' so well suited for NORAML Web applications
